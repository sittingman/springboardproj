    "<p>Answer the following questions <b>in this notebook below and submit to your Github account</b>.</p> \n",
    "\n",
    "<ol>\n",
    "<li>  Is the distribution of body temperatures normal? \n",
    "    <ul>\n",
    "    <li> Although this is not a requirement for the Central Limit Theorem to hold (read the introduction on Wikipedia's page about the CLT carefully: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_limit_theorem), it gives us some peace of mind that the population may also be normally distributed if we assume that this sample is representative of the population.\n",
    "    <li> Think about the way you're going to check for the normality of the distribution. Graphical methods are usually used first, but there are also other ways: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normality_test\n",
    "    </ul>\n",
    "<li>  Is the sample size large? Are the observations independent?\n",
    "    <ul>\n",
    "    <li> Remember that this is a condition for the Central Limit Theorem, and hence the statistical tests we are using, to apply.\n",
    "    </ul>\n",
    "<li>  Is the true population mean really 98.6 degrees F?\n",
    "    <ul>\n",
    "    <li> First, try a bootstrap hypothesis test.\n",
    "    <li> Now, let's try frequentist statistical testing. Would you use a one-sample or two-sample test? Why?\n",
    "    <li> In this situation, is it appropriate to use the $t$ or $z$ statistic? \n",
    "    <li> Now try using the other test. How is the result be different? Why?\n",
    "    </ul>\n",
    "<li>  Draw a small sample of size 10 from the data and repeat both frequentist tests. \n",
    "    <ul>\n",
    "    <li> Which one is the correct one to use? \n",
    "    <li> What do you notice? What does this tell you about the difference in application of the $t$ and $z$ statistic?\n",
    "    </ul>\n",
    "<li>  At what temperature should we consider someone's temperature to be \"abnormal\"?\n",
    "    <ul>\n",
    "    <li> As in the previous example, try calculating everything using the boostrap approach, as well as the frequentist approach.\n",
    "    <li> Start by computing the margin of error and confidence interval. When calculating the confidence interval, keep in mind that you should use the appropriate formula for one draw, and not N draws.\n",
    "    </ul>\n",
    "<li>  Is there a significant difference between males and females in normal temperature?\n",
    "    <ul>\n",
    "    <li> What testing approach did you use and why?\n",
    "    <li> Write a story with your conclusion in the context of the original problem.\n",

    "The mean normal body temperature of 98.6F is not necessarily true in today's population. In fact, the sample temperature mean is 98.2F, which is 0.4F below the historical mean. \n",
    "\n",
    "Why the decrease? One area which would worth exploring is the current living environment. Perhaps more people have moved to warmer areas, in which their body temperatures don't need to stay that high to remain warm. With the advance in technology, a lot of labor intensive works are replaced by machine. As a result, people no longer need to eat that much food to perform daily tasks, hence less energy needed in the body, hence the decrease. In related to that, people today have more clothing and shelters for body protection from the wild environment, the biological part of the body may change over time which need less body fat to maintain high body temperature."
